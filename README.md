This website represents my personal effort to learn more about HTML5, CSS3/Sass, React, ES6, as well as other tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I hope to continually improve this app, as it will function as my actual portfolio.

Right now, it has some compartmentalization with compnents for the nav bar, but that's it. There aren't a lot of repeatable pieces in this site. I also have not used any JS6 specifically, just JSX to code into the different pages.

My main improvement on this website versus others I have made is the extensive use of mixins in Sass to make the formatting of each new page easier.

Please enjoy, if not seriously, then at least as a decent looking joke.
